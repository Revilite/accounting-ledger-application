## Description
<img src="images/HomeScreen.png" height="200">

This application is used to create statement on deposits and payments as well as sorting and filtering though a CSV File.
It reads from the CSV File and when creating a transaction to save it writes to the CSV line by line. When searching you are able to search for any
value of the transaction you would like, as well as last month and year as well as current month and year.
The entire project is case-handled, meaning that if the user inputs something that they're not supposed to or misclicks, the project won't break and 
can be handled.

## When using the app

Make sure that you understand what screen you are on. Some can look similar but have different values, The name of the actions is always to left of the
value to enter so it's clear to show what to enter. It  is not case-sensitive meaning that you could enter a lowercase,
and it will still work pick up the action. Another thing to remember is to add what the prompt is asking for, and you are able to break  out of the prompt is you enter "x".
